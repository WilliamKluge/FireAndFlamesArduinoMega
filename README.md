# FireAndFlamesArduinoMega

A project for the Arduino Mega to play Through the Fire and Flames on five speakers with ten LEDs blinking corresponding to notes.

Requires small modifications to [Brett Hagman's Tone library](https://github.com/bhagman/Tone) to support the newest Mega.

Uses [GoGo's MIDI converter](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/midi_tone.html) to turn a MIDI into the format used in this program.
